# 🚴 Paris Bike App

An interactive Streamlit application to explore and analyze bike traffic data in Paris.  
This project is based on a dataset of bike counters across the city, enabling users to visualize trends, filter by stations/arrondissements, and analyze traffic patterns.

## 📖 Description

The Paris Bike App allows users to:
- Visualize bike counts over time (daily, monthly, yearly).
- Filter traffic data by specific bike stations or arrondissements.
- Explore patterns using a **heatmap** (day of week × hour of day).
- Gain insights into urban mobility and cycling adoption in Paris.

This project demonstrates how to combine **data science**, **Streamlit** for visualization, and **Docker** for reproducibility.
