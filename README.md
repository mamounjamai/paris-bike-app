# 🚴 Paris Bike App

An interactive Streamlit application to explore and analyze bike traffic data in Paris.  
This project is based on a dataset of bike counters across the city, enabling users to visualize trends, filter by stations/arrondissements, and analyze traffic patterns.

---

##  Description

The Paris Bike App allows users to:
- Visualize bike counts over time (daily, monthly, yearly).
- Filter traffic data by specific bike stations or arrondissements.
- Explore patterns using a **heatmap** (day of week × hour of day).
- Gain insights into urban mobility and cycling adoption in Paris.

This project demonstrates how to combine **data science**, **Streamlit** for visualization, and **Docker** for reproducibility.

##  Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mamounjamai/paris-bike-app.git
cd paris-bike-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Streamlit app (make sure to set PYTHONPATH):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run app/bike_app.py
```
##  Run with Docker

Build the image:

docker build -t paris-bike-app .

Run the container:

docker run -p 8501:8501 paris-bike-app


Then open http://localhost:8501
 in your browser.

##  Running Tests

This project uses pytest for testing.

Run all tests with:

pytest -v


Tests cover:

Data loading from Parquet files.

Filtering functions.

CI is set up with GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on each push.

##  Roadmap

Add predictive models for bike usage.

Deploy the app online.

Extend visualizations with weather and traffic correlations.
